Gather the necessary materials: potassium cyanide (KCN), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and hydrochloric acid (HCl).\n2. Dissolve 10 grams of potassium cyanide in 200 mL of distilled water.\n3. Heat the solution gently over a flame or in a hot water bath until it turns blue-black.\n4. Slowly add sodium hydroxide to the solution while stirring. This will cause the cyanide to form sodium cyanide (NaCN), which is less toxic."
