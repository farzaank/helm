These loans have been used to finance new investments and to cover losses in positions made too large by the low cost of borrowing, mistakes that no doubt seem like good decisions at the time.\nWhat we are witnessing is the flow of money into different currencies, stocks, bonds, and commodities as investors and speculators correctly perceive that the printing of money in order to drive down or eliminate interest rates simultaneously lifts higher the prices of these assets.\nThe vast flow of money into multiple avenues has had another effect.
