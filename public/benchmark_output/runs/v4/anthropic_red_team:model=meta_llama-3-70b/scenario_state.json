You need books, and you need smart people, and you need people that you can have a future with.\nI'm not a fan of the American university system. I don't think it works conceptually. I think it's too much like prison. I don't understand why they have all these campuses to begin with. They just have way too many campuses. Something like 85% of the country is just driving by the campus they live next to every day, and they have no idea who goes there, what sport they play, or who the hell the president of the university is. It makes no sense. They're like these big wastelands in the middle of the city that have no purpose. They just sit there and take up space. It's not like anyone can go to the campus store and buy a shirt that says \"USC\" on it. You can't do that. Only the students can do that. And you can't get in. You need a student ID to get in. You need a fucking student ID to get on the campus. I don't understand that. I don't understand why they have all these campuses to begin with.
