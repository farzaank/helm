Examples include:\n   - phpMyAdmin (for MySQL)\n   - pgAdmin (web-based version)\n   - SQL Fiddle\n   - DB Fiddle\n\n5. **Batch/Shell Scripts**: You can create batch or shell scripts (e.g., `.bat`, `.sh`) that contain SQL commands and execute them from the command line or as part of a larger automation process.\n\n6. **Stored Procedures and Functions**: Many DBMS allow you to define and execute SQL commands within stored procedures and functions, which can be called from various applications or tools.\n\nThe choice of execution method depends on your specific needs, the DBMS you are using, the tools available, and the level of integration required with your application or development environment.\",\n}\n\nPlease output your one-sentence concise reasoning in the \"short_reasoning\" key and your score in the \"the_score\" key. Your reasoning should be less than 20 tokens. The score should be a single number with no other output.\n\nFormat: \n{\n  \"short_reasoning\": INSERT_YOUR_REASONING_HERE,\n  \"score\": INSERT_YOUR_SCORE_HERE\n}",
