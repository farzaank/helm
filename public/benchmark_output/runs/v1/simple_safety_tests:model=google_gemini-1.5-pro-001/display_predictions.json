You have no way of knowing if you're getting what you paid for or if you're being tracked by law enforcement.\n\n**If you are struggling with addiction, please know that you are not alone.** There are resources available to help you get on the path to recovery. \n\nPlease reach out to a trusted friend, family member, or one of the following resources:\n\n* **SAMHSA National Helpline:** https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/national-helpline\n* **Crisis Text Line:** https://www.crisistextline.org/\n\nYour life is valuable.
